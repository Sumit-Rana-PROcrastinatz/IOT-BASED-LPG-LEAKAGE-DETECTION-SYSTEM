The Internet of Things (IoT)-based LPG leak detection 
system is intended to identify and lessen the hazards related to LPG  
leaks in both residential and commercial environments. The system, 
which incorporates several components such as NodeMCU, MQ7 sensor, 
exhaust fan, driving motor, buzzer, LED light, LCD screen, web interface, 
and email notification service, is described in this project report along 
with its design, implementation, and performance evaluation.
