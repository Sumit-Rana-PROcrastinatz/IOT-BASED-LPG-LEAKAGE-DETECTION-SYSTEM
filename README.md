TITLE: IOT-BASED LPG LEAKAGE DETECTION SYSTEM  
With recent trend of technological advancement, this project is a low-cost but 
accurate for detecting LPG leaks in residential and industrial areas. Using sensors, 
exhaust fan, buzzer, motor and wireless technology, the system prevents possible 
dangers as well as notify users.  
The project tackles the growing number of LPG leaks happen, however, at times can 
be associated with danger like ones in fire or health hazards. Conventional tracking 
does not warrant as not only is its precision and efficiency lacking, but also many will 
miss catastrophes. This challenge prompts engineers to a united team which draws 
upon their expertise towards the development of a one-of-a-kind solution, 
incorporating 
IoT 
and 
gas 
detection 
technology. 
The program will include a network of exact gas sensors intended to be placed within 
localities that can be further sub-divided into kitchens, storage units and industrial 
facilities among others. Such sensors get developed with the purpose of detecting 
high pollution in natural habitats. Sensor readings of the IoT set of sensors is fed to a 
central control unit that receives and relays the signals to the network. This, being the 
system's hub, gives it the capability to receive and relay data as well. 


PURPOSE OF THE PROJECT:  
The system detects leaks or abnormal levels and it responds immediately by sending 
real time leakage levels as well as alerts via email and web application. These alerts 
serve the purpose of keeping users and appropriate agencies updated, moving 
towards the action they need. The noise of an audible alarm via a buzzer is another 
preventive measure introduced by the system. It engages an exhaust fan as well as a 
motor, to discharge the gas and switch off the regulator thus potentially quench the 
possible dangers. 
With capabilities of various wireless communication protocols such as Wi-Fi and 
Bluetooth, the NodeMCU control unit can also send real time data via innovative web 
interface and email notification. Users will right away gauge gas levels, leakages and 
environmental conditions by in-built sensors on which they can act instantly. 
The system can be integrated with Machine Learning algorithms to further improve 
the functionality of the system. The ability to save trace data of sensors and historical 
records of the system in the cloud can enable the system to discover and establish 
patterns, foreshadow problems, and optimize performance over time.
